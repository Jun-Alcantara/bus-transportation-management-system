✅ COMPLETED: ProcessRoutesAndRunsValidationAction Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive routes and runs validation system based on student_routes_validation data structure analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Database Structure
- **SrvRoutesAndRunsValidation Model**: `/app/Models/SrvRoutesAndRunsValidation.php`
- **Migration**: `srv_routes_and_runs_validations` table
- **Unique Constraint**: `upload_batch_id + rte_id + run_idx` (ugeocode__ not included in uniqueness)

### Key Validation Logic

#### 1. Route Existence Check
- Validates if `rte_id` exists in the `routes` table
- Flags non-existent routes as `is_new_route = true`

#### 2. Runs Counting
- Counts total unique runs per route (`rte_id`)
- Based on `distinct run_idx` for each route across the batch
- Stored in `runs_count` field

#### 3. Frequency Consistency Validation
- **Critical Logic**: Validates that for each unique combination of `rte_id + run_idx + ugeocode__`, the `run_freq` is consistent
- Groups records by `ugeocode__` within each route/run combination
- Flags inconsistencies when same `rte_id + run_idx + ugeocode__` has different `run_freq` values
- Example of inconsistent frequency:
  ```
  Student 1 | Route 1 | Run 1.1 | MWF | SM
  Student 2 | Route 1 | Run 1.1 | MWT | SM  ← Different frequency for same route+run+geocode
  ```

#### 4. Stacked Runs Detection
- Identifies runs serving multiple schools
- Flags when same `rte_id + run_idx` has multiple `tripasgn_sch_code` values
- Example of stacked runs:
  ```
  Student 1 | Route 1 | Run 1.1 | MWF | SM | 846
  Student 2 | Route 1 | Run 1.1 | MWF | SM | 845  ← Same route+run, different schools
  ```

### Data Grouping Strategy
- **Main Processing**: Groups by `rte_id + run_idx` (not including ugeocode__)
- **Frequency Validation**: Within each route+run group, validates by ugeocode__
- **Runs Counting**: Counts distinct run_idx per route across entire batch

### ProcessRoutesAndRunsValidationAction
Location: `/app/Actions/ProcessRoutesAndRunsValidationAction.php`

**Key Methods:**
- `processRoutesAndRuns()`: Groups data by route+run combinations
- `validateRouteAndRun()`: Performs all validations for each route/run
- `countRunsForRoute()`: Counts total runs per route
- `checkFrequencyConsistency()`: Validates frequency consistency by ugeocode
- `checkForStackedRuns()`: Detects multiple schools per run

**Validation Results Stored:**
- `is_new_route`: Boolean - route doesn't exist in routes table
- `has_inconsistent_frequency`: Boolean - frequency conflicts found
- `has_stacked_runs`: Boolean - multiple schools detected
- `runs_count`: Integer - total runs for this route
- `validation_details`: JSON - detailed validation information

This implementation correctly handles the requirement that ugeocode__ is only relevant for frequency validation, not for general route/run uniqueness or counting.
