Let's create a new module called Student Data Upload. 
The main function of this module is to allow user to upload multiple excel file at once. 
Then the backend should store this file to local storage. 
- User's should be able to create an "Upload Batch" record. The Upload Batch record should contain the ff. details:
    - User uploaded the file
    - Name of the bacth
- Users should be allowed to edit the name of "Update Batch" record
- Users must be allowed to manage each Upload Batch. So each upload batch has an inner page that shows a Upload file form. 
- The Upload File form should have only 1 input called Student Routes File. 
- The Student Route Files should be drag and drop file input that accepts multiple xls and xlsx
- The Upload File should have "Upload" button. When click it should submit the form to the backend. Add some upload progress animation. 
- Update Batch is only deletable when there's no Files attached to it.
- Create a new model StudentRoutesValidation in the backend that will store the Student Route Files data from the front-end.
- Use @.claude/data-source-sample.xlsx headers to create the data. If incase you can't read .xlsx you I converted it to csv file with the same header stored in @.claude/data-sample.csv
- Create a controller that will process and store the data from the Upload File form and store it in StudentRoutesValidation.
- Create a new model store the file details of the uploaded files from "Upload Files" form

The instructions have already feed and process by claude, here's continuation and bugs.
- When I try to drag and drop the first file, it listd the file below correctly. When I drag and drop a second file, it replaces the first file instead of just adding up.
- When I click the "Upload" button, there's an error in the console. "Show.jsx:91 Upload error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getAttribute')"
