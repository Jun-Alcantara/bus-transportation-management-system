Let's create a new Model in the back-end. 
let's name called it SrvStudentInformation - srv_student_informations
Let's create a function that will process data from student_routes_validation. 
I am thinking like processStudentInformation(UploadBatch $uploadBatch) -> select * from student_routes_validation where upload_batch_id = 1
I don't UploadBatch has direct relationship to StudentRoutesValidation
If there's no relationship, use UploadedFiles UploadBatch hasMany UploadedFiles and student_routes_validation has uploaded_file_id column. 
What we are going to do in processStudentInformation is. 
I want to extract the unique student from student_routes_validation and save it in SrvStudentInformation
Then foreach student, I want to check if the student exist using the stu_autoid column in student_routes_validation from students.student_code.
If the student does not exist, let's flag this student is new student in SrvStudentInformation.
I want to also monitor the updates in student_special_needs, I want to make sure that these columns are unique per each student. 
stuneeds_need1
stuneeds_need2
stuneeds_need3
stuneeds_need4
stuneeds_need5
stuneeds_need6
stuneeds_need7
stuneeds_need8
stuneeds_need9
stuothneeds_need5
stuothneeds_need4
If not, let also flag it and store it in SrvStudentInformation
