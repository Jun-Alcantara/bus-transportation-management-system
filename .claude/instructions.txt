Let's create a new module called "Routes & Runs"
This is a CRUD of Routes that hasMany Runs.
I want to be able to create a Route with:
school_year_id belongsTo school_years table. (you can get the active school year using a helper function `active_school_year`)
school_term_id belongs To school_terms table. (you can get the active school year using a helper function `active_school_term`)
district - belongsTo districts table
name - string
code - string
description - optional string
status
date_deactivated
date_activated

Routes can have a multiple Runs
Runs have:
school_year_id belongsTo school_years table. (you can get the active school year using a helper function `active_school_year`)
school_term_id belongs To school_terms table. (you can get the active school year using a helper function `active_school_term`)
Route_id = belongs to routes table
run_code - description
status
date_deactivated
date_activated

I want to be able to create multiple runs along with the route creation
